# Customer Insights and Business Recommendations

This repository contains a data-driven project aimed at analyzing customer behavior and providing actionable business recommendations based on insights derived from multiple datasets. The project involves data cleaning, analysis, and visualization to support decision-making processes.

## Project Structure

### 1. Datasets

The analysis is based on three datasets stored in the `Assignment.xlsx` file:

- UserDetails Dataset: Contains demographic details of customers such as age, location, and preferences.
- CookingSessions Dataset: Includes data related to cooking sessions and their timing.
- OrderDetails Dataset: Captures information about customer orders, including meal types, dishes, and order timings.

### 2. Code and Analysis

The primary analysis and visualization code is in the `untitled1.ipynb` file, a Jupyter Notebook developed using Google Colab. This notebook includes:

- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and preparing the datasets for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncovering patterns and trends in customer behavior.
- Visualizations: Creating insightful plots (e.g., histograms, bar charts, pie charts) to illustrate key findings.

## Key Features

1. Comprehensive Data Cleaning:
   - Ensures datasets are accurate and ready for analysis.

2. Customer Insights:
   - Analyzes age distribution, location trends, favorite meals, and order frequency.

3. Visualizations:
   - Engaging plots to make data-driven insights more understandable.

4. Business Recommendations:
   - Provides actionable suggestions to optimize marketing, operations, and customer satisfaction.
